 flavor_mng.28.d:1 "The Censorate is a highly effective and influential branch of our government. Under the direct authority of the Emperor, its primary role is to extend the authority and vigilance of the Emperor to all the branches of administration, providing detailed reports on the palatial conduct of various bureaucrats, exposing corruption and serving as a strong moral compass. Recently, refined administrative capabilities have allowed us to further expand the influence of one aspect of the Censorate's responsibilities, further ensuring the stable conduct of our subjects."

It is the dawn of a new age, as the multicultural society of this domain is naturally pushed towards progress due to the mixture of very different traditions that has occurred." #UU Modded
 flavor_gbr.23.desc:0 "The Iberian connection began centuries ago, with royal marriages between kings and princesses such as those of Alfonso VIII of Castile to Eleanor, daughter of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine; Edward I of England to Eleanor of Castile, sister of Alfonso X of Castile; or the most recent case of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, third son of Edward III, who claimed the throne of Castile through his marriage to Constance of Castile, daughter of the deposed Peter I.\n\nThis connection has been recently restored and enforced, as all the kingdoms of Iberia have come under our rule, and we are now in a position to declare the Union of Iberia as one of the Crowns of our United Kingdom." #UU FIXED HORRIFIC GRAMMAR
