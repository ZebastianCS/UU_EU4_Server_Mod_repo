  uufulojihad.40.d:0 "Originating from the Tekrur area in the northwestern Sahel, the Fulani people have migrated eastward in recent centuries to settle in Hausaland, Borno, and beyond. The migrations consisted mainly of pastoralists who brought with them their cattle but adopted local languages. That being said, they pride themselves on being one of the first groups in Western Africa to convert to Islam, and many Fulani are active in promoting the spread of Islam in the region.\n\nRecently, a Fulani scholar of Islam in [Root.Capital.GetName] has begun preaching within our lands, advocating not only for conversion of non-Muslims but critiquing existing Muslim elites for their perceived violations of Islamic law. This preacher has since become very popular within our country, and a movement for social reform has begun to amass around him."
