Looking out the window, suddenly a shining light dazzles [From.From.From.Owner.Monarch.GetName], as Saint Dream appears before him. In a mighty flemish accent, the Saint speaks: I bless you and your country, let it grow and prosper and not die to an AI. [From.From.From.Owner.Monarch.GetName] passed out shortly after. As [From.From.From.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] wakes up, [From.From.From.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] does not remember much, but feel a tingling sensation of having been in the presence of something holy."

With them, foreign tactics and expertise that saved the waning sultanate from annexation from the Lodi in Delhi. Initially a favourite interest group of the Sultan, they gradually gained more power, and have established communities even in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].\n\nNow, a descendant of the old Sharqi sultans again sits on our [Root.GovernmentName]'s elected throne, but holds power only insofar as his Lithuanian and Nepali supporters support him. As Nepal’s golden age showed more and more signs of faltering, the powerful Lithuanian magnates began to demand the fulfilment of promises made by his dynasty over 150 years ago - the restoration of their people to their homelands. They spoke of riches in furs and grain in abundance, and promised the establishment of an eternally loyal client state and the great wealth of the fabled Baltic to the Nepali [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] if he would but sponsor this final crusade."

However, the explorers swore up and down that they truly had found the fabled city of gold - and truly they had arrived at [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] bedecked in gold and jewels, and even some "native Indian inhabitants" in tow. The riches they brought with them were also great and splendid to behold, but ultimately were only enough to cover the expenses of the expedition. In any case, our intrepid explorers seemed to have used the wrong method but ended up with the right answer(?)"
