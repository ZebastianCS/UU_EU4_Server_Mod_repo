#Main Section Missions
 uu_spa_plus_ultra_title:0 "Plus Ultra"
  uu_spa_plus_ultra_desc:0 "What lies beyond the Pillars of Hercules? Our brave explorers are ready to find out!"
 uu_spa_discover_new_colonies_title:0 "Discover New Colonies"
  uu_spa_discover_new_colonies_desc:0 "Our explorers en route to India have returned with tales of vast unclaimed lands out there for the taking. We must survey these potential findings to see if any are worth setting up permanent bases in."
 uu_spa_tordesillas_title:0 "Treaty of Tordesillas"
  uu_spa_tordesillas_desc:0 "Though we have managed to stabilize our realm and our relationship with the Kingdom of Portugal, a haphazard colonization plan will undoubtedly lead to territorial disputes and unnecessary tension with our closest neighbour. Let us formalize our spheres of influence in the wider world, so that we can grow our empires unperturbed by each other."
 uu_spa_reconquista_granada_title:0 "Reclaim Andalucia"
  uu_spa_reconquista_granada_desc:0 "The Moors have enjoyed our patience for hundreds of years. Remove them and reclaim Andalucia for the [Root.GetAdjective] Crown."
 uu_spa_iberia_christian_title:0 "Convert Iberia"

 uu_spa_reconquista_morocco_title:0 "Continue Reconquista"
  uu_spa_reconquista_morocco_desc:0 "Further to our claims in Iberia, we should establish our presence in a few cities in North Africa to protect against invasion, and act as a buffer zone shielding Iberia from further Muslim aggression."
 uu_spa_destroy_berber_piracy_title:0 "Break the Berber Pirates"
  uu_spa_destroy_berber_piracy_desc:0 "The pirates and slavers from the Barbary Coast have been thorns in our side for too long, abducting civilians to sell into slavery and pillaging goods from our coasts. We must make a show of force against these fiends, and stop their harassment of Iberian shores."
 uu_spa_secure_the_coast_title:0 "Secure the Coast"
  uu_spa_secure_the_coast_desc:0 "With the pirates defeated, our merchants have started to gain commercial interests in the area. Capturing a few key trade ports for the Crown would not only help cement our influence over the region, but also enrich our coffers."
 uu_spa_destroy_morocco_title:0 "Crush Morocco"
  uu_spa_destroy_morocco_desc:0 "The Kingdoms of Morocco from dynasty to dynasty have provided a safe place for enemies of [Root.GetName] to gather forces and launch attacks across the strait, and will be a perennial source of trouble for us as long as they remain independent. We must take their mountainous strongholds and capture their palaces, and drive the infidels to the Sahara!"
 uu_spa_army_ready_title:0 "Prepare our Forces"
  uu_spa_army_ready_desc:0 "The past decades have not been particularly kind to [Root.GetName]. In order to deal with the troubles ahead, we must ensure our soldiers and sailors are equipped for it."

 uu_spa_acquire_bullion_title:0 "Gold in Tafilalt"
  uu_spa_acquire_bullion_desc:0 "The 15th century saw large-scale shortages of precious metals throughout Europe, as outflow of gold and silver to the East outpaced production from mines. Our recent gains in Africa mean that we are in a strong position to seize the gold mines at Tafilalt, and secure another supply of precious metals for our mints."
 uu_spa_turk_holy_league_title:0 "The 1571 Holy League"
  uu_spa_turk_holy_league_desc:0 "A new heathen threat rises in the Eastern mediterranean, and actively makes attacks on Christendom's merchants. His Holiness has decided to call for a new coalition of Christian powers, to combat the naval threat on behalf of all Christians in Europe. This is an excellent opportunity for [Root.GetAdjective] sailors to prove their worth while also serving the greater good of Europe."
 uu_spa_spanish_armada_title:0 "Spanish Armada"
  uu_spa_spanish_armada_desc:0 "The British isles have become a hotbed for heretic activity, insulated from the rest of Europe.

Our Great and Most Fortunate Navy shall be able to withstand any foe and any storm."
 uu_spa_secure_treasure_fleets_title:0 "Secure Treasure Fleets"
  uu_spa_secure_treasure_fleets_desc:0 "As our empire grows, the amount of riches being brought back from our overseas territories grows also. If we can protect these crucial shipments from pirates, our merchants will become more confident, and we will be able to bring back more cargo in safety."
 uu_spa_rule_hispania_title:0 "Hispania Rules The Waves"
  uu_spa_rule_hispania_desc:0 "[Root.GetName] will be the foremost naval power of the world - born not out of vanity, but of necessity. Our international empire demands protection, and we must be able to provide it by making sure none can challenge us on the high seas."
 uu_spa_weather_civil_war_title:0 "The Castilian Civil War"
  uu_spa_weather_civil_war_desc:0 "Before we take any more measures to expand our realm, we must first deal with the growing troubles within. Our Kings have been weak, and our line of succession questionable. If our realm is to not fall to pieces, we must ensure there is no question of who the rightful monarch is, one way or another."
 uu_spa_navarra_title:0 "Subjugate Navarra"
  uu_spa_navarra_desc:0 "The branch of the House of Trastámara that rules over the Kingdom of Navarra has begun to show signs of weakness and internal strife. We must settle their disputes by bringing Pamplona firmly under our rule."
 uu_spa_iberian_hegemon_title:0 "Iberian Hegemon"
  uu_spa_iberian_hegemon_desc:0 "We stand atop the peninsula as the strongest ever Christian power to rule these lands. Our realm stretches from the Pyrenees to Seville. Whether we choose to expand our influence in Europe or to seek out riches in the New World, our subjects at home can rest assured that they have a strong army and competent government to protect them."
 uu_spa_supplant_genoa_title:0 "Supplant Genoa"
  uu_spa_supplant_genoa_desc:0 "The city of Genoa was for a time the most important port in the Western Mediterranean.

 uu_spa_protectors_of_the_western_med_title:0 "Mediterranean Protector"
  uu_spa_protectors_of_the_western_med_desc:0 "As our trade dominance grows, more and more merchants look to us for protection from the reaving pirates. If we can use our past experiences fighting the Berber raiders to rid the Sea of privateers, our name will carry great power in Mediterranean mercantile politics."
 uu_spa_aragon_title:0 "Claims in Aragon"
  uu_spa_aragon_desc:0 "The Crowns of Aragon and Castile historically have had very close dynastic ties, but this has also led to their nobility meddling in our internal politics to the point of causing civil wars. We must curtail the power of these nobles one way or another."
 uu_spa_trastamara_domain_title:0 "Trastamara Domains"
  uu_spa_trastamara_domain_desc:0 "The Kingdoms of Sicily and Naples were periodically ruled by Aragonese kings in the preceding centuries, and most recently captured by Alfons 'The Magnificent' of Trastamara in the mid-1400s. However, he chose to split his realm and leave Naples to his illegitimate son in his will. Alfons was a fool, and with our recent consolidation of the holdings of House Trastamara, Sicily and Naples are simply natural extensions of this policy."
 uu_spa_control_pope_title:0 "A Loyal Papacy"
  uu_spa_control_pope_desc:0 "Though we are one of the foremost Catholic states, His Holiness in Rome is not always recognizing of our efforts. Let us rectify that by ensuring he knows full well our abilities to defend Christianity."
 uu_spa_intervene_in_italy_title:0 "Intervene in Italy"
  uu_spa_intervene_in_italy_desc:0 "The Italian peninsula, long disunited, has become a diplomatic skirmishing ground for the other major European powers. We must take measures to curb their influence in the region, and extend our own networks there instead."

  uu_spa_embrace_counter_reformation_desc:0 "A new war against God is being waged in Europe, this time by fellow Christ-adherents. This heretical nonsense has no place in [Root.GetName], and to prove our devoutness we will formally join the war against the heresy. The Lord knows those who are His!"
 uu_spa_win_league_war_title:0 "Win the League War"
  uu_spa_win_league_war_desc:0 "Having dealt with the Protestants domestically, we must now take the fight to their strongholds in Germany. We must cleanse the so-called 'Holy' Empire of the Germans and reestablish Catholicism as the one true faith in Europe."
 uu_spa_catholic_monarchy_pogchamp_title:0 "A Catholic Monarchy"
  uu_spa_catholic_monarchy_pogchamp_desc:0 "The faithful adore us. The heretics fear us. The pope has blessed us. We are truly deserving to be called the Catholic Monarchy, as no other Catholic kingdom is as pious or has done enough to fight heresy as we have."

 uu_spa_california_title:0 "Colonize California"
  uu_spa_california_desc:0 "Extending our reach into California would be a natural extension of the borders of New Spain. Though unsubstantiated, there are rumors of virgin gold deposits in the region that we must secure, if indeed they exist."

  uu_spa_spanish_main_desc:0 "The Main, as it has become known, can be sighted from the decks of our trade ships before they dock at Hispaniola. If the prosperity of the Caribbean is any indication, it would be worth exploring the Main thoroughly."

  uu_spa_potosi_silver_desc:0 "We have discovered silver deposits that are rich beyond anything we have ever seen, at a mountain aptly named 'Cerro Rico', or the Rich Mountain. The value of this silver is estimated to be so great that it far outweighs the cost of buying new slaves, so we should not hesitate to work our slaves to death mining it."
 uu_spa_la_plata_title:0 "Colonize La Plata"
  uu_spa_la_plata_desc:0 "The verdant riverlands of the Rio de la Plata, or the River of Silver, should make an excellent site for a new colonial venture."

 uu_spa_christianize_america_title:0 "New World Missions"
  uu_spa_christianize_america_desc:0 "We must not ignore the spiritual goals of our conquest of the New World; we are here not only for profit, but for the sake of enlightening the heathen peoples who call this land home.

 #Events
 uu_spa_events.1.t:0 "The Question of Portugal"
  uu_spa_events.1.desc:0 "From our shared origins fighting back-to-back against the Moorish invaders, to the Treaty of Alcanizes in 1297, our kingdom and the Portuguese kingdom have historically been on good terms. However, as with Aragon, supporters of Portugal in our realm have been interfering with our domestic politics, with pretenders to our throne even gaining support from sympathetic Portuguese allies. As the Reconquista draws to a close, the bonds holding our kingdoms together as allies is weakening. It is now time for us to choose whether our closeness with Portugal is worth the trouble it can bring, or if our kingdoms can continue to prosper in friendship and alliance forever more."
  uu_spa_events.1.a:0 "Let us continue the fight against the infidels together, as the best of allies."
  uu_spa_events.1.b:0 "Portugal is nothing more than a future subject."
 uu_spa_events.2.t:0 "Naval Dominance Lost!"
  uu_spa_events.2.desc:0 "The Iberian brutes have utterly destroyed our proud fleets in recent conflicts. Though once all the Christians of the Mediterranean feared the African reaver, they mock us now from behind the wooden wall of the Spanish fleets. This seems to have affected our sailors too, as now no one wants to go on slave raids or enlist in the navy for fear of ending up at the bottom of the sea, or worse captured and tortured by the ever-present hostile fleets."
  uu_spa_events.2.a:0 "How will we rebuild our navy, if no one is even willing to try?"
 uu_spa_events.3.t:0 "The Desolation of Tenochtitlan"
  uu_spa_events.3.desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Tenochtitlan, the once-great city rivalling Paris and Constantinople was practically razed to the ground. The siege led to widespread famine and plague, and the ensuing plunder of the city spared neither soldier nor civilian as houses were emptied of goods and palaces despoiled for treasure. Nonetheless, as the former capital of the Aztec Empire situated in the middle of a lake, the location remains both strategically and symbolically significant. Our conquistador in charge of the victorious army, whether out of remorse or simply ambition, has put forward a proposal to rebuild the city in the Spanish style, and thus found a new capital city from which our colony can be ruled. However, looking out at the hellscape before them and the sheer amount of damage wrought upon the site, it is hard for any to even imagine how it might look like..."
  uu_spa_events.3.a:0 "Forge ahead with the construction, this city will be the heart of New Spain."
  uu_spa_events.3.b:0 "There's nothing of value left for us here. Just gather the loot lying around and go."

  uu_spa_events.4.desc:0 "The Kingdom of Morocco was at last conquered. The last Sultan was captured and taken into custody last month, where he remains as merely another prisoner. Instead of symbols of the false god and heathen kingdoms which fly from the mosques and kasbahs of the Atlas mountains, there now triumphantly stand crosses and [Root.GetAdjective] flags. With this final victory, we have proved to both our own citizens and to the other Muslim powers that Iberia is at last safe from Muslim aggression. The Reconquista is over, and there will never again be a need for another. \n\nHowever, amidst the celebration, important matters remain still to be attended to. The Moroccans are unlikely to remain pacified, and we must quickly decide by what means we will administrate this newly-conquered territory and keep it stable without emptying the royal Treasury."

  uu_spa_events.999.desc:0 "The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed in Tordesillas, Spain on 7 June 1494 and authenticated in Setúbal, Portugal. It formally divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe into two spheres of influence along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands, off the west coast of Africa. The lands to the east would belong to Portugal and the lands to the west to Castile. The treaty ensured the two colonial powers could remain relatively friendly with each other, instead of becoming rivals competing for similar areas." 
  uu_spa_events.999.a:0 "Great."
